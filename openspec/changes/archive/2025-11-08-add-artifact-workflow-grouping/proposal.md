# Add Artifact Workflow Grouping and Airflow Integration

## Why
Artifacts are currently stored with workflow metadata (workflow_id, execution_id, step_name) but are displayed as a flat list. Users cannot easily:
- See which artifacts belong to the same workflow execution
- Understand the relationship between artifacts (e.g., charts → LLM analysis → signals)
- Navigate from Airflow run details to the artifacts generated by that run

This creates friction when debugging workflows, analyzing trading decisions, or auditing ML experiments.

## What Changes
- **Frontend Artifact Page**: Add grouped view that organizes artifacts by workflow execution
- **Airflow Run Details Modal**: Display generated artifacts for each workflow run
- **API Enhancement**: Add endpoint to query artifacts by execution_id
- **Navigation**: Enable click-through from Airflow → Artifacts → Details

### New Capabilities
1. Grouped artifacts view showing all artifacts from a single workflow run
2. Workflow execution metadata displayed as section headers (execution_id, timestamp, status)
3. Airflow run details modal includes "Generated Artifacts" section
4. Direct links from Airflow runs to artifact detail pages
5. Visual grouping with expand/collapse functionality

### Technical Implementation
- Update `frontend/templates/artifacts.html` to fetch and group by execution_id
- Update `frontend/templates/airflow_monitor.html` run details modal
- Add Alpine.js state management for grouped/flat view toggle
- Use existing artifact API with filtering by execution_id

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- **artifact-management** (NEW) - Artifact storage, retrieval, and visualization
- **airflow-integration** (NEW) - Integration between Airflow workflows and artifact tracking

### Affected Code
- `frontend/templates/artifacts.html` - Add grouped view UI
- `frontend/templates/airflow_monitor.html` - Add artifacts section to run details
- `backend/api/artifacts.py` - May need filtering enhancements (already supports execution_id)
- `backend/api/frontend.py` - No changes (routes already exist)

### Breaking Changes
None - This is purely additive functionality.

### User Experience Impact
- **Before**: Flat list of artifacts with no relationship indication
- **After**: Organized view showing artifacts grouped by workflow execution with full context

### Performance Impact
- Minimal - Using existing database indexes on execution_id
- Frontend grouping done client-side with Alpine.js
- No additional API calls required (data already fetched)
